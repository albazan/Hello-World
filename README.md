# Hello-World

Hey everyone,

Little spill about myself, I am a new father and have been interested in web design and development for some time. Nothing to get your rear into gear like a child. I created a web page for the baby shower and for family that do not have social media to view pictures of our journey; you can check it out at babybazan.com. 

I plan to continue my learning in web design and development, to start a career in this field.
